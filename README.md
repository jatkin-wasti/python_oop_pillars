# OOP
### Step 1:
- Creating an Animal class as our Parent class
### Step 2:
- Creating a Reptile class as a Child class of Animal
- Why? So that we can Inherit behaviour (functions) from the Parent class
- This uses **Abstraction**
### Step 3:
- Creating a Snake class as a Child class of Reptile
### Step 4:
- Creating a Python class as a Child class of Snake
